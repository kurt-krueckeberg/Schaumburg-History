  <h2>Separate Development in Schaumburg after 1647&mdash;Grafschaft Schaumburg, Lippe Portion/Schaumburg-Lippe</h2>

The Lippe portion of Schaumburg, which was fortunate enough to produce a few capable rulers who devoted themselves entirely to the welfare of their small country, developed differently. One of the most important
and famous among them is Count Wilhelm (r. 1748—1777), who was found by King Ludwig I of Bavaria to be ranked among the great Germans in the Valhalla Gallery of Honor with a bust. Born in London,
after a temporary stay in Geneva and studying in Leiden and Montpellier, he got to know Italy in the Austrian army. As Field Marshal in the Brunswick—Lüneburg / British service he fought
successfully in the Battle of Minden in 1759 in the Seven Years' War and secured the independence of Portugal against France and Spain in 1762. New military—theoretical concepts, he built his own country
so that it could be defended in the event of war. He was the first to introduce general conscription and built the fortress Wilhelmstein in the Steinhuder Meer. The war school that he set up on the
Wilhelmstein produced the Prussian army reformer Gerhard Scharnhorst.  He promoted agriculture and industry in his country; he established colonist villages, improved the school system and maintained a
written exchange of ideas with people like Frederick II of Prussia, Voltaire, Mendelssohn, Möser and Gleim; at his court he drew the polymath Johann Gottfried Herder (1771—1776 Konsistorialrat in
Bückeburg), the philosopher Thomas Abbt and the &quot;concert master&quot; Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, the &quot;Bückeburger Bach&quot; (1750—1795 in Bückeburg). Contrary to family tradition,
he had Wilhelm's tomb, a pyramid with Masonic symbols, built in the middle of the Schaumburg Forest.
<br>
<br>
the political practice of the 18th century, the Lippe part of the Grafschaft Schaumburg with the residence Bückeburg developed into the independent Grafschaft Schaumburg—Lippe. After the end of the
Old Kingdom (1806), the little country even experienced an increase in rank when its regent Georg Wilhelm assumed the title of prince on his own initiative in 1807: the county now became the principality of
Schaumburg—Lippe, which claimed full sovereignty.
<br>
<br>
Prince Georg Wilhelm (1807—1860), after the devastating Napoleonic wars, the country's economic development was promoted in a targeted
manner. The traffic connections were considerably simplified when the railway line (Dortmund —) Minden—Hanover (— Berlin) was opened
in 1847 and Schaumburg—Lippe joined the Prussian customs area in 1854. Agriculture remained an important factor despite
industrialization. It was freed from shackles by releasing services or taxes and by dividing mean things. All of this led to a surge in
modernization like never before. The mining and glass industry in Obernkirchen in the Electorate of Hesse radiated far into the
Principality of Schaumburg—Lippe. With the establishment of the Georgschachts near Stadthagen, the height of the mining industry in
Schaumburg was reached. The 20th century flourished until it came to an abrupt end in 1961. In addition, the princely court and lordly
forests offered many occupations.
<br>
<br>
industrialization of Schaumburg was favored by the relatively high population density, the existing mineral resources (coal, sandstone)
and the favorable traffic situation (railway, Weser, Mittelland Canal, motorway since the 1930s). In Schaumburg, agriculture, mining
and the glass industry, not least small businesses (basket weavers) and migrant work (herring fishing), developed alongside each
other—not evenly distributed, but with a different focus.  Industrial cities based on the model of the Ruhr area or the
neighboring Hanover (Linden) did not emerge in Schaumburg, rather the settlement structure in Schaumburg remained village—like and
small—town.
<br>
<br>
The principality's claim and reality increasingly diverged over the course of the 19th century. Although Schaumburg—Lippe retained its
independence in 1866, it lagged behind general developments in the modernization process and had to accept help from Prussia wherever
the small state was overwhelmed by a modern administration. Post and justice, schools and medical systems were gradually placed under
Prussian supervisory authorities. After the military was completely transferred to Prussia in 1867, the 7th Westphalian Jäger Battalion
was relocated from Kleve to Bückeburg and Stadthagen; the prince of Schaumburg—Lippe became head of the &quot;Bückeburger Jäger&quot;.
In the political discussion from about 1840 onwards, Schaumburg—Lippe became more and more the proverbial object of ridicule against
outmoded small states.
<br>
<br>
Shortly before the end of the monarchy, the princes added a few highlights to their residence: Prince Georg (1893—1911)—whose brother Adolf was
married to the imperial daughter Viktoria and lived in the &quot;Palais Schaumburg&quot; in Bonn—added the palace in the neo—baroque
style completely redesigned the castle courtyard, which has since been flanked to the right and left by two &quot;cavalier houses&quot;
in the revived Weser Renaissance style. Georg's son, Prince Adolf (1911—1918), built a mausoleum in the Bückeburg Palace Park, which
is unparalleled in terms of size and furnishings and which stood in strange contrast to the actual importance of his principality. He had
Bad Eilsen, which was founded by Princess Juliane (1761—1799), expanded into a handsome health resort.
<br>
<br>
When the monarchy in Germany generally ended, with the abdication of Prince Adolf on November 15, 1918, the Principality of
Schaumburg—Lippe also disappeared; With the SPD at the head of the political parties, the young republican Free State shared the fate of
the other countries up to 1945.
<br>
<br>
A peculiarity of the denominational history also came to an end: up until then, the ruler of the Evangelical—Lutheran state church of
Schaumburg—Lippe was the supreme bishop ; the ruling house, however, was Reformed denomination. In 1918 the church regiment of a
Reformed sovereign over a Lutheran regional church also ended. It has survived to this day as one of the smallest regional churches in
Germany.
<br>
<br>
The transitional position between Westphalia, to which Schaumburg belonged until the end of the Old Reich, and Hanover in Lower Saxony,
which has always been very attractive, made the question of Schaumburg—Lippe's membership appear open again after World War II,
as the states North Rhine—Westphalia and Lower Saxony were newly formed. By decision of the British military government, the state of
Schaumburg—Lippe was transferred to the newly created state of Lower Saxony in November 1946, together with the states of
Braunschweig, Hanover and Oldenburg. The Schaumburg—Lippe district was formed from the former state (after the two districts of
Bückeburg and Stadthagen were merged in 1948). The seat of the new district administration was established in Stadthagen.
<br>
<br>
The independence of the country had always been up for discussion. On June 6, 1926, the population decided in a referendum with a clear
majority against annexation to Prussia; on February 24, 1930, the two—thirds majority required for the union did not come about in
the state parliament. Independence was once again put up for discussion in 1975. In a national referendum, the population of
Schaumburg—Lippe voted for independence. It was not granted. If the Schaumburg—Lipper wanted to express their displeasure against the
fact that Lower Saxony had taken over the former state assets and only returned a small part to the district, then the referendum was a
success: the return of the previous property was achieved.
