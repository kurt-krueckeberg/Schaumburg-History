The Reformation was introduced relatively late in 1559 under Count Otto IV (1544-1576), who was initially on the Catholic side. Otto had studied in Leuven, was bishop of Hildesheim from 1531 to 1537 and took part in the war against France on the Spanish side before he married Elisabeth Ursula zu Braunschweig and Lüneburg, a daughter of Duke Ernst, the confessor, in 1558. Protestant teaching was introduced in Schaumburg under their influence. The two monasteries of Obernkirchen and Fischbeck have survived to this day as Protestant women's monasteries.
<br />
<br>
The county experienced its cultural climax under Otto's son Ernst (1601-1622). Ernst was born in Bückeburg in 1569, in Detmold at the court of Simon VI. Growing up in Lippe, had studied law in Helmstedt, stayed in Kassel at the court of the highly learned Landgrave Moritz and got to know the art and culture of Italy and the Netherlands on educational trips through half of Europe. He took the sister of Landgrave Moritz, Hedwig, as his wife. Advised by outstanding men, he reorganized the country's finances, led the country to economic prosperity and reorganized it. In 1606 he moved the main residence from Stadthagen to Bückeburg, which he expanded according to his high plans and demands. The golden hall with its god gate still impresses every Bückeburg castle visitor with its splendor; The town church and the market square including the adjoining buildings can also be traced back to Count Ernst. The mausoleum in Stadthagen by Giovanni M. Nosseni and his important sculptures by Adrian de Vries, the academic high school in Stadthagen and the University of Rinteln were all set up by him. He gave the country a police order (1615) and a church order (1614), some of which remained in force well into the 19th century. His funds, which came largely from the Schaumburg mining industry, were also sufficient for a larger loan that he made available to the emperor. In gratitude, Count Ernst was elevated to the rank of prince in 1619.

<br />
<br>
The University of Rinteln was founded in 1621 with imperial privilege. The equipment was initially sufficient for twelve professors and several dozen scholarships. After a promising start, it experienced a sudden slump in 1622 due to the death of its founder and the turmoil of the 30 Years War. With around 150 students, it was one of the smaller universities; their geographical catchment area was limited to the near to further surroundings of north-west Germany.
<br />
<br>
On the whole, its reputation among academic institutions has remained rather modest. There was little protest when they were abolished in 1810 and their property was incorporated into the University of Marburg; the archive was largely destroyed. The university buildings were demolished and the "Ernestinum" grammar school was built in their place.
<br />
<br>
When Prince Ernst was buried in his mausoleum in Stadthagen on March 21, 1622, troops of the Imperial League marched through the Weser valley against the "mad" Duke Christian of Braunschweig and Lüneburg; the 30 Years War had reached Schaumburg. Like all of Germany, the population suffered from billeting, extortion and pillage; Plague and want did the rest. Again and again the Weser valley was used as a passage and deployment area. One of the few major battles took place on June 28, 1633 near Hessisch Oldendorf; it ended victorious for the evangelical party without, however, exerting any significant influence on the further course of the war.
<br />
<br>
Prince Ernst had died childless. The legacy came to the Gemener line of the Schaumburg Count House. Count Otto V took part in a war council of the Protestant party in Hildesheim in 1640, when the participants at a banquet, as it is said, was mixed with poison. In any case, Count Otto V died a few days after his return from Hildesheim on November 15, 1640, and with him the last male Schaumburger. With his death, the "old county of Schaumburg" came to an end. The inheritance was to be divided. Otto's mother Elisabeth, daughter of Simon VI. zur Lippe, transferred all rights to her brother Philipp. The external relations fell away: The County of Pinneberg and the Lordship of Bergen were sold, the Lordship of Gemen fell to the Counts of Limburg, the pledged County of Sternberg to Lippe. Several parties made claims to the original lands on the Weser: Braunschweig-Lüneburg moved in the Lauenau office, the bailiwick of Lachem, Mesmerode and Bokeloh as well as Wiedensahl as a settled fiefdom; The Landgraviate of Hessen-Kassel and the Duchy of Minden also asserted feudal claims, and the Counts of Lippe made inheritance claims. The old county of Schaumburg was divided into two equal halves: The Counts of the Lippe (branch line Alverdissen) received the offices of Arensburg, Bückeburg, Stadthagen Hagenburg and half of the office of Sachsenhagen; Hesse received the offices of Rodenberg and Schaumburg and the southern half of the Sachsenhagen office. The property of the University of Rinteln (until 1665), the Weserzölle (until 1734) and the mines (until the 20th century) remained jointly. Minden, ruled by the Swedes, came out empty-handed in the end. In several contracts this regulation was 1647 and in Article XV of the 14./24. October 1648 between the emperor and Sweden concluded the Westphalian peace treaty conclusively sealed.
